The Dow Jones Industrial Average reached a record yesterday, an intraday high of 21,165, to be exact. For the faithful and the detractors, it'd be interesting to ask, what's the chance we've just witnessed the permanent top of the stock market. It's not enough to be a temporary top; it has to be the high that we will never see again in our lifetime.
