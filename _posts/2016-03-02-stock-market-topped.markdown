(Warning : this is a technical piece about stochastic processes wrapped in a familiar subject. Would help to know the basics of brownian motion and first passage time.)

The Dow Jones Industrial Average reached a record yesterday, an intraday high of 21,165. For the faithful and the detractors it's provocative to ask, what's the chance we've just witnessed a permanent top. By permance, I mean that investors would never see this level again from now till time infinity. 

Wise men of stock market would tell you that no one knows the absolute peak (and trough) until long after the fact. That's what make market timing so difficult.

Let's make a formal statement, which reads like this, 

> Null Hypothesis : Dow Jones has peaked at 21,165.

It'd be easy to reject this hypothesis. All we need is for the Dow to rise above this level. If that happens tomorrow, we are done.

The case is more interesting if the Dow go down today, the day after, and keep on going. After a while, we seem to have evidence that what we saw yesterday was really the peak.   

Let's say, after a couple of days, the Dow dropped $$x$$ points. The question is, what's the chance that it would not recover $$x$$ for at least $$n$$ days. Later on we would make $$n$$ go to infinity.
