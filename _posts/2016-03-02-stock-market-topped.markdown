The Dow Jones Industrial Average reached a record yesterday, an intraday high of 21,165, to be exact. For the faithful and the detractors, it's provocative to ask, what's the chance we've just witnessed a permanent top. I mean, from now till end of the world, investors would never see this level again. 

Wise men of stock market would tell you that no one knows the absolute peak (and trough) until long after the fact. That's what make timing such an intriguing endeavour.

Okey, now you'd ask, what evidence do I have to support any claim of analysis and knowledge of market top.
